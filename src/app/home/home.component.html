            <h4>The Art Institute of Chicago</h4>
            <h4 class="subheading">Art Gallery</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">The Art Institute of Chicago is a world-renowned art museum housing one of the largest
                permanent collections in the United States. An encyclopedic museum, the Art Institute collects,
                preserves, and
                displays works in every medium from all cultures and historical periods as well as hosts special
                exhibitions.
                With a collection of more than 260,000 artworks and artifacts, the museum has particularly strong
                holdings in
                Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting, early twentieth-century European painting and sculpture,
                contemporary art, Japanese prints, and photography.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">As a research institution, the Art Institute also has a conservation and conservation science department,
                five conservation laboratories, and Ryerson and Burnham Libraries, one of the nation's largest art
                history and architecture libraries.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">The growth of the collection has warranted several additions to the museum's 1893 building, which was
                constructed for the World's Columbian Exposition. The most recent expansion, the Modern Wing designed by
                Renzo Piano, opened in 2009 and increased the museum's footprint to nearly one million square feet,
                making it the second-largest art museum in the United States, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art
                The Art Institute is associated with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a leading art school,
                making it one of the few remaining unified arts institutions in the United States.</p>
